# Graphics-Pack-Preset---FiveM

Preset available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1btSa8-b4WCpqwGPMF3SlT8GfSytBTFOp?usp=sharing
due to file size limitations.

Windows search the following location and unzip the pack to there:

%localappdata%\FiveM\FiveM Application Data\

There are two versions available. One is just the FiveM graphics ReShade pack and the other is the same but with the ability to add DLSS3 which is the one I use. To get access to DLSS3 (Or DLSS4/FSR depending on what your GPU supports) you will need to subscribe here: [https://www.patreon.com/c/PureDark/posts](https://www.patreon.com/c/puredark/membership) where his DLSS3/DLSS4/FSR plugin is available.
