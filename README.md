# Graphics-Pack-Preset---FiveM

Preset available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1btSa8-b4WCpqwGPMF3SlT8GfSytBTFOp?usp=sharing
due to file size limitations.

Windows search the following location and move the pack to there:

%localappdata%\FiveM\FiveM Application Data\
The .bat file will also open this directory for you.

My in game render resolution is set to 1707x960 and output to 2560x1440 due to the use of a DLSS3 plugin made available for a performance improvement. If you do not utilise the AMD FSR or Nvidia DLSS plugin then turn this up otherwise if you wish to get access to DLSS3 (Or DLSS4/FSR depending on what your GPU supports) you will need to subscribe here: [https://www.patreon.com/c/PureDark/posts](https://www.patreon.com/c/puredark/membership) where his DLSS3/DLSS4/FSR plugin is available. Do note not all GPU's will either 1. work or 2. perform effectively depending on the GPU model. I utilise DLSS3 on an RTX 4060.
